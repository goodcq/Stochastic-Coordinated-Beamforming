# Abstract:

Transmit optimization and resource allocation for wireless cooperative networks with channel state information (CSI) uncertainty are important but challenging problems in terms of both the uncertainty modeling and performance optimization. In this paper, we establish a generic stochastic coordinated beamforming (SCB) framework that provides flexibility in the channel uncertainty modeling, while guaranteeing optimality in the transmission strategies. We adopt a general stochastic model for the CSI uncertainty, which is applicable for various practical scenarios. The SCB problem turns out to be a joint chance constrained program (JCCP) and is known to be highly intractable. In contrast to all of the previous algorithms for JCCP that can only find feasible but sub-optimal solutions, we propose a novel stochastic DC (difference-of-convex) programming algorithm with optimality guarantee, which can serve as the benchmark for evaluating heuristic and sub-optimal algorithms. The key observation is that the highly intractable probability constraint can be equivalently reformulated as a dc constraint. This further enables efficient algorithms to achieve optimality. Simulation results will illustrate the convergence, conservativeness, stability and performance gains of the proposed algorithm.
